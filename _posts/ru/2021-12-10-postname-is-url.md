Over the last year I’ve had a chance to learn a lot more about early stage funding and made angel investments in a handful of startups. So far I’ve restricted my involvement to companies with ideas in which I have significant domain knowledge. I also insist on founders with relentless product focus, a fierce desire to help their customers be more awesome, and excellent communication skills. I recently met just such a company, with just such founders, tackling a problem that has personally caused me much pain.

The company is Replicated, and founders Grant Miller and Marc Campbell are making it easier to roll out an on-prem Enterprise offering based on an existing cloud-based SaaS product.

At GitHub, we burned through a lot of developer cycles building our own installer (several times), securing the installation environment, coding an automated licensing management system, integrating single sign-on services (LDAP, Active Directory, CAS, etc, etc), building out a searchable audit system, supporting customer-reviewable support bundles (logs and other diagnostic output), allowing numerous backup strategies, and countless other Enterprise-specific features that were killing our Enterprise deals. All of this on top of hiring and building out the necessary sales, support, and accounting teams to create a smooth Enterprise experience for our customers.
